Year Service has not strong correlation to high performer and average rating

### **Succes Formula**
**Success Formula = 0.9 TGV Competency(STO,SEA,etc) + 0.5 TGV Cognitive (IQ,TIki, etc) + 0.5 TGV Experience (Year of Service (Month))**


### Result : 
- **Low Performance Average:** Average competency score only 3.0 (scale 1‚Äì5), with 4.4% classified as High Performers.  
- **Competency Drives Rating:** STO, SEA, and related features strongly influence employee performance.
